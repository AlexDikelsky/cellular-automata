This is an implemenation of Langton's Ant, a type of cellular automata created by Christopher Langton. It's rules are:

Start in the middle of a "sea" of white tiles

If the tile you are standing on is white, change its color to black, then turn right
If the tile you are standing on is black, change its color to white, then turn left

Then go forward depending on which direction you are facing.
